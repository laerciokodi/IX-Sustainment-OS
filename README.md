# IX Sustainment OS

IX Sustainment OS is a **non-weapon, defense-adjacent sustainment operating system** for maintenance, readiness, parts bottlenecks, technical-data access, and auditable AI-assisted decision support.

It is designed to help sustainment organizations answer a simple but high-value question:

**What can we fix right now, what is blocked, why is it blocked, and what evidence supports the next action?**

---

## Why this exists

Sustainment organizations do not fail only because a part is missing.

They fail because the decision chain is fragmented across:
- maintenance records
- fault history
- technical manuals
- entitlement and data-rights boundaries
- parts availability
- approval chains
- inconsistent local workflows
- poor auditability of recommendations and overrides

IX Sustainment OS is intended to unify those fragments into one operational layer.

This repo is being built as a serious product concept for:
- depot maintenance environments
- field sustainment support workflows
- readiness and fleet-health teams
- program offices
- prime contractor sustainment teams
- controlled government or government-adjacent environments

---

## Product statement

**IX Sustainment OS** is a CUI-conscious sustainment platform that combines:

1. **Maintenance triage**
2. **Technical-data and entitlement checks**
3. **Parts and supply bottleneck visibility**
4. **Human-governed AI recommendations**
5. **Tamper-evident operational evidence**

The goal is not to replace maintainers, engineers, logisticians, or program staff.

The goal is to give them a shared operating picture with traceable, reviewable, decision-grade evidence.

---

## Core use cases

### 1) Maintenance triage
A maintainer, analyst, or operations lead needs to:
- ingest a fault or discrepancy
- classify severity and mission effect
- see similar prior cases
- determine if action is possible at current echelon
- identify blockers immediately

### 2) Technical-data access and entitlement
A user needs to know:
- which technical reference applies
- whether access is permitted
- whether a procedure is current
- whether a requested action crosses a data-rights or approval boundary

### 3) Parts and readiness bottlenecks
A sustainment planner needs to know:
- what parts are constraining readiness
- which shortages affect highest-priority assets
- which work orders are waiting on material, approval, tooling, or data
- where local fixes are being delayed by process, not physics

### 4) Human-governed AI assistance
A user needs machine support for:
- suggested triage paths
- likely fault families
- recommended next-step evidence collection
- probable bottleneck causes
- prioritization support

But every recommendation must remain:
- reviewable
- attributable
- overrideable
- auditable

### 5) Evidence for oversight and coordination
Leads and program stakeholders need a record of:
- who saw what
- which data informed a recommendation
- which user approved or rejected it
- what changed
- when it changed
- under which policy boundary it changed

## What this product is not

IX Sustainment OS is **not**:
- a weapon system
- a targeting platform
- a strike-planning tool
- a kill-chain optimization system
- a battlefield fires-control product
- an autonomous engagement system

It is also **not** intended to make unsupported claims such as:
- automatic authority to operate
- automatic CMMC compliance
- automatic NIST certification
- replacement of official logistics or maintenance systems of record

This project stays on the sustainment, readiness, workflow, auditability, and human-governed decision-support side.

---

## First-release product wedge

The first credible wedge is:

**“A sustainment triage and bottleneck operating layer for maintenance, parts, entitlement, and auditable AI recommendations.”**

That means Release 1 focuses on six modules:

### A. Case Intake
Structured fault and discrepancy intake with mission context, asset context, severity, and supporting evidence.

### B. Triage Board
A queue-based operational view for fault families, blockers, aging items, and recommended next actions.

### C. Technical Data Gateway
Controlled linking of procedures, references, revisions, access restrictions, and entitlement status.

### D. Parts Bottleneck Board
Visibility into work stoppage causes driven by supply, tooling, approval, or documentation constraints.

### E. Recommendation + Approval Layer
AI-assisted recommendations that remain human-reviewed, policy-bounded, and fully logged.

### F. Audit and Evidence Ledger
A durable record of actions, approvals, overrides, recommendation provenance, and state transitions.

---

## Primary users

### Maintainer / technician
Needs fast clarity on what to do next and what is blocking execution.

### Production controller / planner
Needs queue visibility, blocker trends, and work prioritization.

### Supply / logistics analyst
Needs shortage impact visibility and readiness consequence mapping.

### Sustainment engineer
Needs case history, recurring fault visibility, and procedure/evidence traceability.

### Program or operations lead
Needs readiness picture, delay cause concentration, and accountable decision history.

### Compliance / security reviewer
Needs role boundaries, policy enforcement, evidence trails, and reviewable AI behavior.

---

## Product principles

### 1. Human authority stays in the loop
Recommendations can assist, but accountable humans approve meaningful actions.

### 2. Evidence beats black boxes
Every important suggestion must trace back to observable inputs, policy context, and user action.

### 3. Workflow over dashboard theater
This product must reduce friction in real operational flow, not just look impressive in screenshots.

### 4. Policy-aware by default
Data exposure, recommendations, and workflow actions must respect access and policy boundaries.

### 5. Sustainment first
Every feature should improve one of these:
- maintenance velocity
- blocker identification
- readiness clarity
- evidence quality
- coordination speed

---

## High-level architecture

IX Sustainment OS is planned as a modular web platform with policy-bounded services.

### Planned layers

#### 1. Experience layer
Mission-critical operator UI for:
- queue triage
- case review
- approvals
- parts impact views
- evidence inspection

#### 2. Application layer
Business logic for:
- case lifecycle
- blocker classification
- workflow transitions
- approvals
- recommendation routing

#### 3. Policy and trust layer
Controls for:
- role-based access
- entitlement checks
- recommendation gating
- approval requirements
- action logging

#### 4. Data layer
Structured objects for:
- assets
- cases
- discrepancies
- procedures
- parts constraints
- approvals
- evidence events

#### 5. Integration layer
Connectors for:
- maintenance systems
- reference libraries
- supply feeds
- identity providers
- export/report pipelines

---

## Planned object model

The repo will be built around a small, serious domain model.

### Core entities
- **Asset**
- **Case**
- **FaultEvent**
- **ProcedureRef**
- **EntitlementRule**
- **PartConstraint**
- **Recommendation**
- **ApprovalDecision**
- **EvidenceEvent**
- **UserRole**
- **PolicyBundle**

### Core states
A case will generally move through states such as:
- `new`
- `triage`
- `awaiting-data`
- `awaiting-parts`
- `awaiting-approval`
- `actionable`
- `deferred`
- `resolved`
- `closed`

---

## AI boundary

AI in this platform is **assistive**, not sovereign.

AI may help with:
- classification support
- similarity matching
- next-step suggestion
- blocker explanation
- prioritization hints
- summarization of case history

AI may **not** silently:
- execute irreversible actions
- bypass approvals
- bypass access policy
- rewrite audit history
- promote itself to decision authority

The system must preserve:
- recommendation provenance
- confidence or uncertainty markers
- user override capability
- reviewable change history

---

## CUI and security posture

This project is being shaped for **CUI-conscious environments**, which means the design intent includes:
- least-privilege access boundaries
- strong auditability
- role-aware data exposure
- secure defaults
- reviewable workflow actions
- deployment patterns compatible with controlled environments

Important:
**This repo does not claim certification, accreditation, or compliance by declaration alone.**
Those outcomes depend on deployment, controls, environment, documentation, and assessment.

---

## Commercial direction

The commercial objective is straightforward:

- allow serious evaluation
- protect monetizable production value
- preserve leverage for pilots, support, and enterprise deployment

The planned licensing posture for this repo is:
- **Business Source License 1.1** for the public codebase
- **separate commercial terms** for production, pilot, support, and controlled deployment use

The actual license text and commercial-terms file will be added in follow-on commits.

---

## Success criteria

This repo is successful if a serious buyer can look at it and say:

- this solves a real sustainment workflow problem
- this is disciplined, not vague
- this respects policy and audit boundaries
- this could be piloted without pretending to be a weapon or autonomous command layer
- this has enough architecture, workflow clarity, and product seriousness to justify a conversation

---

## Current status

This is the founding commit.

It establishes:
- product identity
- operating boundary
- user problem framing
- first-release wedge
- architecture direction
- commercial posture
- repo shape

All implementation, policy files, schemas, and scaffolding follow from here.
